usage:
deodexerant <odex_file> <port>

deodexerant is a binary that is intended to run on an android phone, in order
to provide assistance to baksmali in deodexing .odex files. It communicates
over TCP and implements a simplistic protocol for looking up various
information needed during the deodex process, which can only be provided by
the dalvik vm. I.E. vtable lookups, field lookups by byte offset, superclass
lookups for classes not defined in the .odex file being processed, etc.

deodexerant is intended to be build within the AOSP build system. Assuming
you have $MYDROID set to the root of the AOSP source tree, and $SMALI
set to the root of the smali source tree,

1. cp -r $SMALI/deodexerant $MYDROID/dalvik/deodexerant
2. cd $MYDROID/dalvik/deodexerant
3. source ../../build/envsetup.sh
4. mm

It should should spit out a deodexerant binary at

$MYDROID/out/target/product/common/system/bin/deodexerant

Or wherever your current build setup is configured to stick those types of
things
